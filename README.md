RNA Ribose Backbone Calculator
Description
The RNA Ribose Backbone Calculator reads an inputted PDB file and calculates the dihedral angles of the ribose backbone. It determines whether the ribose is in a C3' endo or C2' endo conformation. The calculator provides a table of the calculated angles for further analysis and a visual model for interactive exploration.

Features
Dihedral Angle Calculation: Computes angles of the ribose backbone.
Conformation Analysis: Identifies C3' endo and C2' endo ribose conformations.
Data Output: Generates a table of calculated angles.
3D Visualization: Displays a model for visual interaction with the RNA structure.
