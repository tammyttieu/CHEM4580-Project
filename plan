# Outline/ Plan 

## 1. code reads PDB file and creates an interactive 3D model 

## 2. write code to calculate the dihedral angles of the ribose backbone and display it in a table

## 3. Calculate the tan(P) and v(max) values and display it in a table
## Maybe plot it on a graph for visualization 

## 4. Based on the tan(P) and v(max) values, have the code display whether the RNA model is C3'-endo or C2'-endo 

## 5. (Unsure whether or not I'm going to do) write code to calculate the dihedral angles of the phosphate backbone and display it in a table 

## 6. Have the code display whether the RNA is a A-form helix (RNA) or a B-form helix (DNA)
